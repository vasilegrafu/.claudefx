# doc-types/ — reference

The curated taxonomy of document types. The authoritative, always-current list
is generated — `../CATALOG.md` (names + purposes, grouped by domain) or
`python builder.py --list` (names by domain). This file is the human map: the
same types organized into meaningful groups, with notes the flat list can't
carry.

Each type is a folder `doc-types/<domain>/<name>/` holding a `usage.md` and a
`document.html.j2`. The type's identity is its own folder name (unique across
all domains) — commands take the type name alone, never the domain. Types marked
† are universal patterns whose recipes are still software-flavored — reusable in
other fields with judgment (each carries a "Beyond software" note in its
`usage.md`).

## Abbreviations

When the user gives an abbreviation, translate it to the full type name (the
builder accepts only full names): ADR → architecture-decision-record, SRS →
software-requirements-specification, PRD → product-requirements-document, SOW →
statement-of-work, SDD → software-design-document, RTM →
requirements-traceability-matrix, API spec → api-specification, SLA →
service-level-agreement, postmortem → incident-postmortem, CR → change-request,
runbook → deployment-runbook or operations-runbook (ask which if ambiguous),
retro → sprint-retrospective, changelog → release-notes.

## Adding a doc-type

Add `doc-types/<domain>/<name>/{usage.md, document.html.j2}` (pick the domain
folder from above; a genuinely new domain gets a new folder — the builder
discovers recursively). See `../SKILL.md` → "new type" for the template shape,
and run `python builder.py catalog` afterward.

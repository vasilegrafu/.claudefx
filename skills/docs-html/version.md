# docs-html — version history

The SINGLE source of truth for the design-system version is `version.json`
(machine-readable); this file is its human ledger — newest release first, one
entry per version, written when the version is bumped. No version number lives
anywhere else (not in the CSS, not in the JS, not in documents).

Semver contract:
- **PATCH** — visual fix, no markup contract change. Safe for every document.
- **MINOR** — additive: new component, new style, new JS feature.
- **MAJOR** — the markup contract changed; documents must opt in to upgrade.

A published version is immutable: any change, however small, is a new version.

## 3.0.0 — 2026-07-22

**Charts changed their markup hook, and gained a whole component category for
investing.** The breaking change is the first one; the second is purely
additive.

### Breaking — charts name their engine

`pre.chart` alone is no longer a recognised markup hook. A chart block now wears
two classes: `chart`, the marker every chart engine shares, and a second class
selecting the engine.

```html
<pre class="chart">…</pre>                   <!-- 2.x -->
<pre class="chart apache-echarts">…</pre>    <!-- 3.0 -->
```

The macro is renamed to match: `c.chart_echarts()` → `c.chart_apache_echarts()`.

Why: charts had no engine seam. Everything lived in one `chart.js` — the
validated categorical palette written directly into an **ECharts theme object**,
the card, the source fallback, `data-height`, the resize reflow — so a second
engine could not have reused the palette the dataviz method validated, and had
nowhere to hook. Diagrams solved this in 1.8.0 with a shared viewport plus one
engine file beside it; charts now use the same split.

- Added: `js/modules/charts.js` — the shared, engine-agnostic chart frame,
  `docsHtml.chart`. Owns `PALETTE` and `TOKENS` **as plain data in no engine's
  format**, `Frame` (card, canvas, `data-height`, source hiding, toolbar), one
  debounced resize dispatch for the whole page, and `markError`.
- Added: `js/modules/chart-apache-echarts.js` — the engine. Owns the pinned
  `echarts@5.5.1` CDN and *translates* the shared tokens into an ECharts theme.
- Renamed: CSS layer `chart` → `charts`. `css/modules/chart.css` becomes
  `charts.css` (frame, toolbar, and the `pre.chart` readable-source fallback —
  one definition for every engine) plus `chart-apache-echarts.css`.
- Moved: the component leaves `components/diagrams/` for a new twelfth category,
  `components/charts/`. A chart is data; a diagram is a drawn relationship.
- **New: a chart toolbar.** Every rendered chart now carries download-as-SVG and
  copy-source, top-right of the card — from the shared layer, so any future
  engine inherits them.
- Rebrand the dataviz palette in `js/modules/charts.js` now, not in the engine.

Adding a chart engine is documented in `js/REFERENCE.md` as the same five
mechanical steps as a diagram engine.

### Added — the `investing` component category (45 components)

An eleventh component category for documents that must support an allocation
decision: buy, hold, sell, size, or wait. Nothing in it is a prettier table —
each component encodes a rule its `usage.md` enforces.

- The security and the call: `security-header`, `recommendation`.
- Company analysis: `thesis-pillars` (claim + evidence + **falsifier**),
  `scorecard`, `metric-trend`, `valuation-multiples`, `peer-comparison`,
  `earnings-surprise`, `valuation-range` (football field), `catalyst-timeline`,
  `expected-value`.
- Statements: `income-statement`, `balance-sheet` (with an explicit
  assets = liabilities + equity check), `cash-flow-statement` (with the free
  cash flow derivation), `dcf-summary`, `segment-reporting` (revenue share vs
  profit share), `footnote-disclosures`. Statement lines cross-reference notes
  via `note=` → `id="note-N"`.
- Decomposition and valuation: `bridge` (waterfall, cumulative maths done at
  compose time), `sensitivity-table`, `roll-forward`, `dupont`,
  `capital-allocation`, `composite-score`, `debt-maturity`, `working-capital`.
- Portfolio and market: `holdings-table`, `performance-table`, `exposure-bars`,
  `risk-metrics`, `trade-log`, `attribution`, `drawdown-table`, `stress-test`.
- Economy and strategy: `macro-indicators`, `cycle-position`, `heatmap`,
  `five-forces`, `quadrant-map`, `funnel`, `cohort-table`, `unit-economics`,
  `ownership-table`, `variance-analysis`, `aging-schedule`, `covenant-table`.

**No new JavaScript.** Every bar width, bar offset and plot position is computed
at compose time and carried as a `data-` attribute read by CSS `attr()`, so the
authoring contract's ban on `style=` holds throughout; each component also
prints its own values, so nothing becomes unreadable without `attr()`.

`css/modules/investing.css` defines four shared skins rather than 45 bespoke
ones: `table.fin` (a marker class every numeric table opts into), `.statement`,
the labelled-bar figure row, and the level-graded cell grid. It is layered after
`business` so `valuation-multiples` and `covenant-table` can reuse `.badge`.

**Migration.** Only charts need action. In each document, change
`<pre class="chart">` to `<pre class="chart apache-echarts">`; the JSON spec
inside is untouched, as is every other component. A document with no chart in it
upgrades to 3.0.0 by changing the version in its two hrefs, nothing else.

Documents already published against `@1.x` or `@2.x` need no action at all: each
pins an immutable tag and loads the assets of that tag, so it keeps its old
markup *and* the code that understands it. Verified against
`data-analysis-report-apple-income-fy2025.html` (pinned `@2.0.0`), which still
renders unchanged.

## 2.0.0 — 2026-07-21

**draw.io / diagrams.net support is removed.** `pre.drawio` is no longer a
recognised markup hook — this is the breaking change. Mermaid is now the only
diagram engine.

Why: draw.io diagrams are mxGraph XML with **no auto-layout** — every box needs
an explicit `x`/`y` and every connector a hand-picked exit/entry side and a
routed corridor. Authoring or editing one by hand (or by assistant) means
solving a layout problem before saying anything about the system, and the
results collide and overlap as soon as the diagram changes. Mermaid's dagre
layout removes that entire class of work: you write relationships, it places
them. The 3.6 MB diagrams.net bundle goes with it.

- Removed: `js/modules/diagram-drawio.js`, `css/modules/diagram-drawio.css`,
  `components/diagrams/diagram-drawio/` (`c.diagram_drawio()`), and the pinned
  `jgraph/drawio@24.7.17` CDN dependency.
- **Unchanged: everything else.** `pre.mermaid`, `pre.chart`, and every other
  component keep their exact markup. A document that has no `pre.drawio` in it
  upgrades to 2.0.0 by changing the version in its two hrefs, nothing else.
- **The multi-engine architecture stays** — deliberately. `diagrams.js` remains
  the shared, engine-agnostic viewport and `diagram-mermaid.js` remains *one*
  engine beside it, not merged into it. Adding a future engine is still a new
  `diagram-<name>.js` + `diagram-<name>.css` + two list entries and touches no
  existing code; `js/REFERENCE.md` documents the five steps.

**Migration.** Replace each `<pre class="drawio">` with a `<pre class="mermaid">`
holding the equivalent `flowchart` — nodes become ids with shapes
(`[box]`, `([stadium])`, `{diamond}`, `[(store)]`), connectors become
`a --> b` / `a -. label .-> b`, draw.io groups become `subgraph`, and fill/stroke
colours become `classDef` + `class`. Drop every coordinate.

---

## 1.8.0 — 2026-07-21

Diagram subsystem split into shared core + per-engine files. No authored-markup
change (`pre.mermaid` / `pre.drawio` are unchanged), so documents are unaffected.

- JS: `diagrams.js` is now the **engine-agnostic viewport** (`docsHtml.diagram.Viewer`
  — bounded box, pan/zoom, toolbar, fit/reset/fullscreen/download/copy, resize
  grip); `diagram-mermaid.js` and `diagram-drawio.js` only turn source into an
  `<svg>` and hand it over. Mermaid keeps the ✎ editor as its one engine tool.
- CSS: `diagrams.css` (shared chrome) + `diagram-mermaid.css` + `diagram-drawio.css`.
  Runtime classes renamed to neutral `.diagram-figure` / `.diagram-canvas` /
  `.diagram-tools` / `.diagram-resize`.
- draw.io gains the **reset-to-100%** button it was missing, and both engines now
  share one identical toolbar.
- `@panzoom` is gone: pan/zoom is self-contained for both engines (the
  diagrams.net bundle ships a global `Panzoom` that clobbered it).

---

## 1.7.0 — 2026-07-21

- `diagram-drawio` now renders into the same bounded viewport as Mermaid, with
  the on-brand toolbar (zoom % · fit · fullscreen · download SVG · copy XML,
  drag to pan, Ctrl+wheel to zoom) instead of the diagrams.net chrome. The SVG
  carries a `viewBox`, so 100% **fits the column width** with proportional
  height. Pan/zoom is self-contained — the diagrams.net bundle ships a global
  `Panzoom` that clobbered `@panzoom`, so draw.io no longer loads it.

---

## 1.6.0 — 2026-07-20

- New `drawio` feature + `diagram-drawio` component: freeform draw.io /
  diagrams.net diagrams authored as mxGraph XML (`c.diagram_drawio()`,
  `pre.drawio`), rendered to SVG at view time by the pinned diagrams.net viewer
  (`jgraph/drawio@24.7.17`, lazy). For architecture/network/infra with explicit
  layout — complements Mermaid (auto-laid-out). Styled by `diagrams.css`;
  degrades to the XML source if the viewer CDN is unreachable. Additive.

---

## 1.5.0 — 2026-07-20

- New `layout/width` component: wrap any component to give it a fixed width
  (`w`, default `24rem`) with optional `align` (left/center/right). Caps width,
  never overflows. Additive.

---

## 1.4.0 — 2026-07-20

Layout primitives. Additive — existing documents keep working unchanged.

- New `layout` component category (the 10th) with four composable primitives,
  styled by new `css/layout.css` (layer `layout`):
  - `columns` + `column` — a responsive side-by-side row; `column(span=N)` for
    asymmetric splits. Wraps/stacks when narrow.
  - `grid` — an auto-fit grid of equal tiles (`min` sets the smallest tile).
  - `card` — a titled, bordered surface; the natural cell for grid/columns, or
    standalone.
- The single-column reading model is preserved: every layout **collapses to one
  column on narrow screens and in print** (`break-inside: avoid` on cells), so
  layout is an enhancement, never a dependency.
- Showcase gains a Layout band (now ten category bands); `CATALOG.md`
  regenerated.

---

## 1.3.0 — 2026-07-20

Declarative charts. Additive — existing documents keep working unchanged.

- New `chart` feature: `<pre class="chart">` holding a JSON ECharts `option`,
  rendered to **SVG** at view time by Apache ECharts `5.5.1` (lazy, pinned CDN).
  Component `chart-echarts` (`c.chart_echarts()`), styled by new `css/chart.css`
  (layer `chart`). Covers bar/line/area/pie/scatter/heatmap/candlestick — real
  analytical charts, not just Mermaid's `xychart-beta` illustrations.
- Built-in validated `docs-html` theme: the 8-slot categorical palette (fixed
  order, colorblind-checked against the light surface via the dataviz method),
  ink/axis/grid from the base tokens. Never restyle per chart — rebrand once in
  `js/modules/chart.js`.
- Accessible by default: `aria`, hover tooltip, and a legend for ≥ 2 series are
  auto-filled when the author leaves them unset; one y-axis only (documented).
- Degradation: invalid JSON or an unreachable CDN leaves the spec visible as a
  readable code box — nothing breaks.

---

## 1.2.1 — 2026-07-20

Visual patch — no markup change, safe for every document.

- `kpi-tiles`: smaller headline number (`.kpi-value` 2rem → 1.5rem) so tiles
  read as metrics, not banners.

Tooling (unversioned assets, noted for the record): every generated file now
links the version-pinned CDN — the showcase joined documents in dropping local
refs, so all output is shareable as-is; a missing `cdn` in `version.json` is now
a hard error.

---

## 1.2.0 — 2026-07-20

Catalog completion, generated reference, and internal reorganization. Additive —
existing documents keep working unchanged.

- Catalog grows 59 → 84 doc-types; components reorganized into nine category
  folders (structure, content, lists, callouts, blocks, business,
  front-back-matter, diagrams, math). New components: comparison-table, quote,
  meter, risk-matrix, party-block, footnotes.
- New generated `CATALOG.md` (every component call form + doc-type purpose,
  built from source via `builder.py catalog`), backed by a required
  `{# purpose: … #}` header on every template. `builder.py show <name>` prints
  one item's signature/purpose + usage.md.
- Category/domain `usage.md` blurbs are the single source feeding both
  `CATALOG.md` and the showcase category bands.
- Showcase rebuilt as a category-driven gallery and moved to
  `showcases/components.html` (the builder discovers `showcases/*.html.j2`).
- Page-local CSS via a `{% block head %}` hook; showcase-only chrome left the
  shared stylesheet (`gallery.css` removed).
- Docs restructured: a per-subsystem `REFERENCE.md` (css, js, components,
  doc-types) and a "Documentation map"; SKILL.md slimmed to point at them; every
  per-item `usage.md` opens with a role line.

---

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-19

Multi-domain expansion + CDN-only documents.

- Catalog grows 38 → 59 doc-types across ten domain folders
  (`doc-types/<domain>/<name>/`): general, software, finance, investing,
  accounting, research, economics, engineering, tools, fallback; the builder
  discovers recursively and `--list` groups by domain.
- New components: financial-table, journal-entry, scenarios, pros-cons,
  swot-grid, badge (`business.css`) and formula (`math.css`).
- New `math` feature: LaTeX rendered at view time by KaTeX 0.16.11 (lazy CDN);
  formulas are LaTeX text, never images.
- Charts documented: mermaid `xychart-beta` / `pie` through the standard
  diagram viewport.
- MINOR head-generation change: composed documents now carry version-pinned
  CDN hrefs ONLY (no local paths, no onerror fallback) — fully portable;
  the gallery keeps local refs. Existing documents keep working unchanged.

---

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-19

First versioned release of the two-asset, single-include design system.

- One stylesheet: `css/docs-html.css` (`@layer` + `@import` of `css/modules/`),
  one script: `js/docs-html.js` (loader for `js/modules/`: core registry, util,
  icons, layout-toggle, highlight, diagrams, main).
- Layout invariants: single `<main>` column, components flush-left,
  `--block-gap` external spacing.
- Diagrams: Mermaid at natural size in a bounded viewport — pan/zoom
  (Panzoom), icon toolbar with live zoom-%, fit, fullscreen, download SVG,
  copy source; vertical resize grip; ✎ source editor as a resizable side
  panel with live re-render and Prism-colored overlay.
- Code: documents hold plain text + `data-lang`; view-time coloring (Prism,
  lazy) with the palette in `code.css`.

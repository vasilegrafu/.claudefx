# security-header

_Authoring guidance for the `security-header` component — when to use it, how, and the rules._

Styled by: `css/modules/investing.css`

The identity strip for the instrument a document analyses: ticker, company
name, exchange, and the handful of market facts a reader needs before the
first sentence. It sits directly under the document cover, once, in any
single-name document — earnings note, investment thesis, due diligence report.

```jinja
{{ c.security_header(
    ticker="AAPL", name="Apple Inc.", exchange="NASDAQ", asof="2026-07-17",
    facts=[
        ("Price", "$232.40"),
        ("Market cap", "$3.45T"),
        ("Sector", "Information Technology"),
        ("Fiscal year end", "September"),
    ]) }}
```

Rules: one per document, never repeated per section. Every price-like fact
carries the `asof` date — an undated quote is a wrong quote within a day.
Do not put the recommendation here; that is `recommendation`, deliberately a
separate block so the facts and the opinion never blur together. For a
multi-name document (a portfolio review, a watchlist) use `holdings_table`
instead — this component names one security.

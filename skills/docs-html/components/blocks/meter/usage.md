# meter

Styled by: `css/modules/blocks.css`

A value-vs-target progress bar: label left, value right, a filled track
below. For allocation vs bands, goals, utilization, completion.

`{{ c.meter(label="Equities vs 60% target", value=54, max=60, display="54%") }}`

The fill width comes from a `data-pct` attribute (the authoring contract
forbids `style=`), consumed by CSS `attr()` — supported in current
Chromium/Edge; older browsers show the labeled values with an empty track,
still readable. Rules: `display` carries the human-formatted value; a meter
over 100% clamps visually — say so in `display`.
